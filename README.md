# Story: API for building static web pages to list products

Vim Hortons is our doughnuts business. Due to the pandemic, we have to provide delivery services for our customers. We want to build it ourselves instead of using a food delivery platform. 

We want to provide our customers the ability to login/register, place orders, go through categories of products.
The developer we worked with before managed to create the auth system, but, unfortunately, they found a way to exit Vim (hah!) and they didnâ€™t finish the changes we needed. 

Please add:
- pagination for products controller
- orders controller
- pagination for products
- authorize the API
- tests
- clean code

Bonus: 
- claim-based authorization for editing products
- request validation

- [new] orders API
